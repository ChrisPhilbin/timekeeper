# Time Keeper
Time Keeper is a React on Rails app that allows users to define projects, assign individual tasks to each project and keep track of how much time is being allocated to each individual task.

The inspiration behind this app was sparked by another passion I have outside of programming: automotives. I am planning on flipping cars for profit and I want to be able to identify what items need to be addressed prior to selling a car and tracking how much time is spent on each item. Doing this will better allow me to maintain a certain labor rate.
